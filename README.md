# Active Directory Configuration and Hardening

This project showcases the installation and configuration of Active Directory (AD) for a multi-site environment, focusing on security and management best practices.

## Overview

In this project, I successfully installed and configured Active Directory, creating Organizational Units (OUs) and implementing Group Policies (GPOs) to enhance security and management across multiple sites. Key activities included:

- Installation of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Creation of OUs for USA and Egypt, along with sub-OUs for various departments
- User and group creation, including delegation of controls
- Configuration of Group Policies (GPOs) for password and login security
- DNS configuration for site-specific resolution
- Monitoring and managing Active Directory using Windows Admin Center
